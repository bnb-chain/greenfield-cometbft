# Greenfield CometBFT

Greenfield CometBFT, forked from [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft),
is the consensus layer of Greenfield blockchain.
CometBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a
state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely
replicates it on many machines.

For protocol details, refer to the [CometBFT Specification](./spec/README.md).

For detailed analysis of the consensus protocol, including safety and liveness
proofs, read our paper, "[The latest gossip on BFT
consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938)".

## Disclaimer
**The software and related documentation are under active development, all subject to potential future change without
notification and not ready for production use. The code and security audit have not been fully completed and not ready
for any bug bounty. We advise you to be careful and experiment on the network at your own risk. Stay safe out there.**

## Key features

We implement several key features based on the CometBFT fork:

* Vote Pool. Vote pool is used to collect votes from different validators for off-chain consensus.
Currently, it is mainly used for cross chain and data availability challenge in Greenfield blockchain.
* RANDAO. RANDAO is introduced for on-chain randomness. Overall, the idea is very similar to the RANDAO
in Ethereum beacon chain, you can refer to [here](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/randomness)
for more information. It has some limitations, please use it with caution.
